# Gallery App README

## Problem Statement

The main reason for developing a gallery app is the lack of a centralized system for managing images. Current solutions rely on scattered storage methods, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties in accessing images when needed. Additionally, the manual and time-consuming process of selecting images for traditional galleries poses challenges for both gallery owners and users. Furthermore, the risk of losing access to images due to device loss or damage exacerbates the need for a more reliable and accessible solution.

## Solution Statement

To address these challenges, the development of a gallery app is essential. This app will provide a centralized platform for users to manage, view, add, update, and delete images. By offering a streamlined and efficient process for managing images, the app aims to alleviate the burden of manual selection and improve accessibility, even in the event of device loss or damage. Overall, the gallery app will enhance image management processes, simplify user interactions, and ensure a more seamless and reliable experience for both gallery owners and users.
